# Dixit
I have created this project because i wanted to learn basics of both: spring boot and reactjs. This was my first bigger poroject in both of this technologies and now I would probably create it different and better. In frontend folder there is a reactjs project which is responisble for client side of whole application, and in backend folder there is a java spring boot code which is a server side.
## Getting Started
The whole idea of this app came from desire to create something which provides some fun into the pandemic time. Dixit is a popular board game, where at the beggining every player gets 6 beautifly designed cards and narrator chooses one of his cards and tries to describe it to the rest, in way it is not too obvious. Then others decide which of theirs cards best suits the narrator description. All choosen cards are now shuffled and players are voteing which card belongs to narrator. Then the points are destibuted and next player become narrator.
